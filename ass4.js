//    Assignment 4: Student List Organizer
//  Learning Objctive: Get comfortable with data structures (objects and arrays) and basic
//  functions in TypeScript.
//  Tasks:
//  1. Student Data: The provided code defines an interface named Student that describes
//  student information like name, senior status (true/false), and whether they've completed
//  their assignments (true/false).
//  o Imagine this as a template for organizing student details.
//  2. Student List:
//  o An array named students stores information about several students using the
//  Student template. Think of this array as your class list!
//  3. Find Senior Students with Assignments (Optional):
//  o The code (not shown here) has a function that might find students who are seniors
// and have completed their assignments.
// o Can you guess why this information might be helpful?
// 4. Class List Update:
//  o Imagine you need to update your class list! The code (not shown here) might have
//  a function that removes students who haven't completed their assignments
//  (assuming only seniors are responsible).
//  o Can you think of any reasons why this might be useful (consider limitations)?
// 2. student list
var students = [

    { name: "saba", seniorStatus: true, completeAssignment: false },
    { name: "ali", seniorStatus: true, completeAssignment: false },

// 3. Find Senior Students with Assignments 
function seniorStudents(students) {
    return students.filter(function (student) { return student.seniorStatus && student.completeAssignment === true; });
}

// 4. removes students who haven't completed their assignments
